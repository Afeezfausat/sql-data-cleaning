# SQL Data Cleaning Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates how raw data obtained from a YouTube tutorial
is cleaned using SQL. The main focus of this repository is to showcase
the **data cleaning logic and SQL queries**, not just the final output.

## Dataset
- Source: YouTube tutorial
- Format: CSV
- Status: Raw data available, cleaned output not generated yet
- Location: raw_data/

## Data Cleaning Objectives
The SQL script is designed to:
- Identify and remove duplicate records
- Handle missing or null values
- Standardize inconsistent text fields
- Correct data types and formats
- Improve overall data quality

## Project Structure



## Cleaned Data Status
The cleaned dataset is not included yet.

All data transformations are fully documented in the SQL script located
in the `sql_scripts/` folder. The cleaned output will be generated after
executing the SQL script in a database environment such as MySQL,
PostgreSQL, or SQLite.

This approach emphasizes **process and logic** rather than just results.

## Tools Used
- SQL
- Git
- GitHub

## How to Use
1. Load the raw CSV file into a SQL database
2. Run the SQL script in the `sql_scripts/` folder
3. Review the cleaned data in the database
4. (Optional) Export the cleaned data to CSV and save it in `cleaned_data/`

## Notes
This project is intended for learning and portfolio demonstration purposes.
